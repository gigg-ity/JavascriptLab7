Lesson 3 of 8
Mouse events are among the most fundamental mechanisms in web development for interacting with graphical elements via a pointing device, such as a mouse. These events are crucial for handling user interactions such as clicking, hovering, and dragging, thereby allowing developers to create responsive and intuitive interfaces. Let's delve into the specific types of mouse events and their applications:

Click Event

This is one of the most commonly used mouse events. The click event occurs when the user presses and then releases a mouse button over an element. This event is essential for things like button presses, opening or closing menus, and other clickable actions within web applications.  Below is an example showing how to implement a click event using both an inline event handler and a JavaScript event listener.

    <button id="clickButton">Click me (Listener)</button>
